# Welcome 

Hello and welcome to my tech blog! Here I will be documenting my learning journey as a programmer.

I have been studying for almost a year now, as much as I can while running the family business.

My areas of interest include

* Python Scripting and Problem solving!
* Server Maintenance and experimentation
* Networking 
* Cybersecurity


My current goal is to land a junior dev job working with DevOps. 

Tools I'm currently studying:

* Docker
* Selenium
* Kubernetes
* Ansible
